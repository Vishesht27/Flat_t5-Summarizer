# Flat_t5-Summarizer


This repository contains a small project developed by me that focuses on dialogue summarization using Google's Flat T5 and the Hugging Face library. The project utilizes the DialogSum dataset to train the summarizer model.



## Introduction
Summarizing dialogues is a challenging task due to their dynamic nature and conversational structure. The purpose of this project is to leverage the power of Google's Flat T5 model, combined with Hugging Face's library, to create a dialogue summarizer that can extract key information from conversations and generate concise summaries.

## Dataset
To train the dialogue summarizer, I used the DialogSum dataset, which is a widely-used dataset for dialogue summarization tasks. This dataset contains a diverse collection of dialogues from various domains, making it suitable for training a robust summarization model.

## Model Architecture
The core of this project is Google's Flat T5 model. Flat T5 is a transformer-based language model that has been fine-tuned on a variety of natural language processing tasks, including text summarization. By leveraging the power of pre-trained models like Flat T5, we can achieve impressive results in dialogue summarization.

## Usage
To use the dialogue summarizer, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
2. Download and preprocess the DialogSum dataset for training.
3. ine-tune the Flat T5 model on the preprocessed dataset using the provided Jupyter notebook Flat_t5-Summarizer.ipynb.
4. Once the model is trained, you can use the one_shot_inference() function to generate summaries for new dialogues.


## Results
The trained dialogue summarizer demonstrates promising results in extracting key information from dialogues and generating concise summaries. The model's performance can be further improved by fine-tuning on domain-specific data or by incorporating additional techniques, such as reinforcement learning or transformer-based architectures.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the creators of the DialogSum dataset, Google for developing the Flat T5 model, and the Hugging Face team for their excellent library and support in natural language processing tasks.

## Conclusion
The Flat_t5-Summarizer project showcases the use of Google's Flat T5 and Hugging Face's library to develop a dialogue summarizer. By leveraging the power of pre-trained models and datasets, we can achieve impressive results in summarizing dialogues. I hope this project inspires further advancements in dialogue summarization and contributes to the research community.
